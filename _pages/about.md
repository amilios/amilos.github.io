My name is **Aristides Milios**, and I'm a highly motivated machine learning researcher passionate about making machine learning more **interpretable** and **effective at learning the way humans do**. I am also passionate about promoting **entrepreneurship and design thinking education**, at both the secondary and tertiary level. 

In high school, I co-founded a startup called **Bitness.io**, which went through the Launch36 and Propel ICT accelerator programs in Atlantic Canada, and used WiFi beacons to track customers through brick-and-mortar stores and provide Google-Analytics-style analytics to store owners. 

As part of my efforts to promote **entrepreneurship and design thinking education**, I jointly co-founded **Hoist Halifax**, a club with monthly **workshops for teens** who are interested in technology and entrepreneurship. I was involved in promoting entrepreneurship and design thinking at Dalhousie University for the duration of my studies, going through the rigorous **University Innovation Fellows** program, organized by Stanford's **d.school of Design**, and becoming a Fellow of the program at Dalhousie. As co-president of the **Dalhousie Entrepreneurship Society**, I organized a series of design thinking workshops on campus, open to students of all faculties.

I did two research internships at **MarineTraffic Inc.** (summer 2018 and winter 2019), researching the fusion of **AIS ship tracking data** and **radar-based satellite imagery**, in cooperation with the Institute for Big Data Analytics at Dalhousie University. In the fall of 2019, I completed an internship at the Know-Center research institute in Graz, Austria, doing research into **Active Learning** and **interactive dataset labelling**. 

I completed my **Bachelor of Computer Science with First Class Honours** at Dalhousie in August of 2020, and am now engaging in ML research at Dalhousie until I begin graduate school in the fall of 2021.
